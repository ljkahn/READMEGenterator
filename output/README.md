  # README Generator

  ## Description
- I built this application so I could have an easy way to generate a README file for my projects. With this easy to use generator - I can spend more time working on the project itself and less time worrying about creating a README file. Building this application taught me about how to use node and the command line in even further detail.

## Installation

- To install this application requires the user to install node from https://nodejs.org. Once the command line is open, type in 'npm i' to install the correct version of inquirer from the dependencies.

## Usage


-To install this app, the user must have a command line application in place (VSCode, etc.). From there they will navigate to the directory and open up the 'index.js' file and open their command line. The user must then enter 'node index.js' on the command line and answer the questions. When all the questions have been answered they will either receive a message confirming the completion of their README or an error. The newly created README can be found in the 'output' directory.
